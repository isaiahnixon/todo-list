# Todo List

A todo list web application built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

First you will need node.js and npm.

Once you have those, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/isaiahnixon/todo-list

## Running the tests

The only test as of now is [App.test](src/App.test.js). Feel free to [help out](CONTRIBUTING.md) in writing them.

Run:
