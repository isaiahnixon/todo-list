# Todo List

A todo list web application built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

#### Windows

* [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).

### Installation

## Running the tests

The tests, at this point in time, basically only test that the application renders without crashing. Any [contributions](#contributing) in this area would be much appreciated.
