This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Todo List

A todo list web application built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for the purpose of learning.

## Purpose

This is a really simple project with a ton of inline comments and some good [resources](#Resources) to help you get started learning React.js, no matter what your previous level of JS experience.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)

#### Windows

* [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/isaiahnixon/todo-list
```

```
cd todo-list
```

```
npm install
```

```
yarn start
```

Now the application should be running on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and the output should look something like this:
